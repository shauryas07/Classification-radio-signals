# Classification-radio-signals
The data used consists of 2D spectrograms of deep space radio signals collected by the Allen Telescope Array at the SETI Institute and the spectrograms were treated as images to train an image classification model to classify the signals into one of four classes.(i.e. Squiggle, Narrowband, Noise, Narrowbanddrd)
